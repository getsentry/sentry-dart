### Sentry Self Hosted Compatibility

## 5.0.0

  * This changed the import from `import 'package:sentry_flutter/src/sentry_flutter_web.dart';` 
    to `import 'package:sentry_flutter/sentry_flutter_web.dart';`
  * This could lead to breaking changes. Typically it shouldn't because the referencing file is auto-generated.
* Fix: Prefix classes with Sentry (#357)
  * A couple of classes were often conflicting with user's code.
    Thus this change renames the following classes:
    * `App` -> `SentryApp`
    * `Browser` -> `SentryBrowser`
    * `Device` -> `SentryDevice`
    * `Gpu` -> `SentryGpu`
    * `Integration` -> `SentryIntegration`
