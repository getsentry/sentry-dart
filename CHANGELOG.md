  * The method signature of `Transport` changed from `Future<SentryId> send(SentryEvent event)` to `Future<SentryId> send(SentryEnvelope envelope)`

## Sentry Self Hosted Compatibility

* This version of the `sentry` Dart package requires [Sentry server >= v20.6.0](https://github.com/getsentry/onpremise/releases). This only applies to on-premise Sentry, if you are using sentry.io no action is needed.

# 5.0.0

* Sound null safety
* Fix: event.origin and event.environment tags have wrong value for iOS (#365) and (#369)
* Fix: Fix deprecated `registrar.messenger` call in `SentryFlutterWeb` (#364)

* Fix: Multiple FlutterError.onError calls in FlutterErrorIntegration (#345)
* Fix: Pass hint to EventProcessors (#356)
* Fix: EventProcessors were not dropping events when returning null (#353)

## Breaking Changes:

* Fix: Plugin Registrant class moved to barrel file (#358)
  * This changed the import from `import 'package:sentry_flutter/src/sentry_flutter_web.dart';` 
    to `import 'package:sentry_flutter/sentry_flutter_web.dart';`
  * This could lead to breaking changes. Typically it shouldn't because the referencing file is auto-generated.
* Fix: Prefix classes with Sentry (#357)
  * A couple of classes were often conflicting with user's code.
    Thus this change renames the following classes:
    * `App` -> `SentryApp`
    * `Browser` -> `SentryBrowser`
    * `Device` -> `SentryDevice`
    * `Gpu` -> `SentryGpu`
    * `Integration` -> `SentryIntegration`
    * `Message` -> `SentryMessage`
    * `OperatingSystem` -> `SentryOperatingSystem`
    * `Request` -> `SentryRequest`
    * `User` -> `SentryUser`
    * `Orientation` -> `SentryOrientation`

# 4.1.0-nullsafety.0

* Fix: Do not append stack trace to the exception if there are no frames
* Fix: Empty DSN disables the SDK and runs the App
* Feat: sentry and sentry_flutter null-safety thanks to @ueman and @fzyzcjy

# 4.0.6

* Fix: captureMessage defaults SentryLevel to info
* Fix: SentryEvent.throwable returns the unwrapped throwable instead of the throwableMechanism
* Feat: Support enableNativeCrashHandling on iOS

# 4.0.5

* Bump: sentry-android to v4.0.0
* Fix: Pana Flutter upper bound deprecation
* Fix: sentry_flutter static analysis (pana) using stable version

* Bump: Sentry-cocoa to 6.1.4

# 4.0.2

* Fix: Mark session as `errored` in iOS #270
* Fix: Pass auto session tracking interval to iOS
* Fix: Deprecated binaryMessenger (MethodChannel member) for Flutter Web
* Ref: Make `WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();` the first thing the Sentry SDK calls.
