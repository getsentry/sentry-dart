# `package:sentry` example

The example in this directory throws an error and sends it to Sentry.io. Use it
as a source of example code, or to smoke-test your Sentry.io configuration.

To use the example, create a Sentry.io account and get a DSN for your project.
Replace the `dsn` const value with the one you got from Sentry.io.
Then run the following command :

```
dart example/main.dart
```
