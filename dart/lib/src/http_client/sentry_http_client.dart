/// A [http](https://pub.dev/packages/http)-package compatible HTTP client.
///
/// It records requests as breadcrumbs. This is on by default.
///
/// It captures requests which throws an exception. This is off by
/// default, set [captureFailedRequests] to `true` to enable it. This can be for
/// example for the following reasons:
/// - In an browser environment this can be requests which fail because of CORS.
/// - In an mobile or desktop application this can be requests which failed
///   because the connection was interrupted.
///
/// Additionally you can configure specific HTTP response codes to be considered
/// as a failed request. This is off by default. Enable it by using it like
/// shown in the following example:
/// The status codes 400 to 404 and 500 are considered a failed request.
///
/// ```dart
/// import 'package:sentry/sentry.dart';
///
/// var client = SentryHttpClient(
///   failedRequestStatusCodes: [
///     SentryStatusCode.range(400, 404),
///     SentryStatusCode(500),
///   ],
/// );
/// ```
///
/// It starts and finishes a Span if there's a transaction bound to the Scope
/// through the [TracingClient] client, it's disabled by default.
/// Set [networkTracing] to `true` to enable it.
///
/// Remarks: If this client is used as a wrapper, a call to close also closes
/// the given client.
///
/// The `SentryHttpClient` can be used as a standalone client like this:
/// ```dart
/// import 'package:sentry/sentry.dart';
///
/// var client = SentryHttpClient();
/// try {
///  var uriResponse = await client.post('https://example.com/whatsit/create',
///      body: {'name': 'doodle', 'color': 'blue'});
///  print(await client.get(uriResponse.bodyFields['uri']));
/// } finally {
///  client.close();
/// }
/// ```
///
/// The `SentryHttpClient` can also be used as a wrapper for your own HTTP
/// [Client](https://pub.dev/documentation/http/latest/http/Client-class.html):
/// ```dart
/// import 'package:sentry/sentry.dart';
/// import 'package:http/http.dart' as http;
///
/// final myClient = http.Client();
///
/// var client = SentryHttpClient(client: myClient);
/// try {
///  var uriResponse = await client.post('https://example.com/whatsit/create',
///      body: {'name': 'doodle', 'color': 'blue'});
///  print(await client.get(uriResponse.bodyFields['uri']));
/// } finally {
///  client.close();
/// }
///
/// Remarks:
/// HTTP traffic can contain PII (personal identifiable information).
/// Read more on data scrubbing [here](https://docs.sentry.io/product/data-management-settings/advanced-datascrubbing/).
